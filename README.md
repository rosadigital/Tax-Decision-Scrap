- Example of result:
<p align="center"> <img alt="example_of_data.JPG" title="example_of_data.JPG" src="./assets/example_of_data.JPG" width="600px">

This project was developed using Selenium, as an instrument to open the Browser, navigate in the HTML DOM, and scrape the data.

Finally, an example of data scraped can be seen here: [tax-decision.csv](./tax-decision.csv)

## 💡 Knowledge acquired (conhecimentos adquiridos)

- During this project, I learned:
  - to scrape dynamic pages, that changes their data and structures randomly;
  - to scrape data organized in a list structure instead of a table structure.
  - to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to code reusable pieces of code blueprints; 
  - about Xpath and its structure, using it to navigate in the HTML DOM; and
  - the concepts of axis (relationship between nodes on DOM) to navigate the structure and get the data needed.
